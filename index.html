  <p><ul></ul>Gardener's Heaven germinated in 2022 from a promise to make ‘green and healthy’ a click away for all 
    Indians Having plants in our homes or in our offices doesn’t just look good, it also boosts our mood, makes us 
    more productive, and cleans the air around us by absorbing toxins Most of us being urban dwellers spending
    their days in apartments with limited access to parks and ecological reserves, have no way of feeling 
    close to nature and experiencing the benefits of being around plants. Ordering a pizza is easy but ever  
    heard of ordering a plant to your doorstep? This is where nurserylive comes in. We cater to all kinds of 
    gardening needs ranging from plants, pots, tools, to curated plant-scaping solutions. Our ever-growing platform

    easier. Our garden experts can provide you with guidance for detailed care every step of the way. Having served

    emerge with your own home-grown veggies! We believe that every space can be made more beautiful with plants!
